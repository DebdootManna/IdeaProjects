## DSA practice question answers

1. Array Data Structure
* Key Concepts:
    * Pairing elements based on divisibility conditions.
    * Finding the longest word in a string.
    * Linear and Binary Search, with modifications for integer overflow issues.
* Practice Questions:
    1. Write a program to find pairs in an array where the sum of elements is divisible by (k). Example: Input: ([3, 1, 2, 6, 9, 4], k=5). Output: ((3,2), (1,9), (4,6)).
    2. Write a function to find the longest word in a given sentence and return its length.
    3. Implement binary search for a sorted array. Ensure the implementation avoids integer overflow.

2. Sorting Algorithms
* Key Concepts:
    * Basic sorting techniques (Bubble, Selection, Insertion).
    * Solving problems using linear sorting algorithms like Radix Sort.
* Practice Questions:
    1. Implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort in Java.
    2. Sort an array with all elements sorted except two swapped. Example: Input: ([3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7]). Output: ([3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).
    3. Rearrange elements of an array such that (A[i] \leq A[i+1]) if (i) is even, and (A[i] \geq A[i+1]) if (i) is odd. Example: Input: ([10, 5, 2]). Output: ([2, 10, 5]).

3. Linked List
* Key Concepts:
    * Operations on singly and doubly linked lists.
    * Reversing a list, checking for palindrome, and merging sorted lists.
* Practice Questions:
    1. Write methods for inserting at the front, deleting the last node, and deleting the (n)-th node from the end of a singly linked list.
    2. Implement a function to reverse a linked list.
    3. Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list. Example: Input: ([1, 2, 4]), ([1, 3, 4]). Output: ([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]).

4. Stack and Queue
* Key Concepts:
    * Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
    * Valid parentheses checking and expression conversion.
* Practice Questions:
    1. Implement a stack using arrays and linked lists. Include methods for push() and pop().
    2. Convert infix expressions to postfix and evaluate them. Example: Infix: ((A + B) C). Postfix: (AB+C).
    3. Generate binary numbers from (1) to (N) using a queue. Example: Input: (N=5). Output: (1, 10, 11, 100, 101).

5. Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees
* Key Concepts:
    * Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order.
    * Maximum depth of a binary tree.
    * BST operations like insertion, search, and finding the (k)-th smallest element.
* Practice Questions:
    1. Implement binary tree traversals in recursive and iterative methods.
    2. Write a program to find the maximum depth of a binary tree.
    3. Given a BST, find the (k)-th smallest element.

6. Graph Algorithms
* Key Concepts:
    * Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).
    * Cycle detection and connected components.
    * Special problems like "Maximum Bomb Detonation."
* Practice Questions:
    1. Implement DFS and BFS for a graph given as an adjacency list.
    2. Detect cycles in a directed graph using DFS.
    3. Given a list of bombs with coordinates and ranges, calculate the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated.

7. Hashing
* Key Concepts:
    * Hash table operations with collision handling.
    * Implementing separate chaining and linear probing.
* Practice Questions:
    1. Implement a hash table for managing student records. Support insertion, deletion, and searching of records.
    2. Use separate chaining and linear probing to handle collisions in the hash table.
    3. Write a program to display the state of the hash table after performing various operations.
